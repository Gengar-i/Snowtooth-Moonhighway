# Snowtooth Moonhighway

This application works with Vite, React and Typescript.

With this application you can:

- Check list of Lifts (including name, elevation gain, status)
- Filter list of Lifts by status.
- Open modal with form where you can update status of desired Lift.

Dependencies used in this project:

- React (Typescript)
- Apollo Client
- React-hook-form
- Material UI

I encourage to check helpers.ts file where LIFT_EDITABLE_VALUES contain config for Form.
